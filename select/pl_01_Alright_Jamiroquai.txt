I need your love

so tonight take me there
I feel your sun
start to glow and I know it
let me show you that
I want your love
I need your touch
for the rest of our time
together baby
come fly with me, eternally
you and me

yeah hey alright (right now)

wake up and live forever
yeah hey alright (right now)

I see your eyes
hold the keys to my paradise
summer in your smile
well it makes me feel
so real so real
you tell me things
and my heart sings
to the world
from the islands in the sky
take my hand as
one we will stand
you know it's never never
to say hello to forever
yeah hey alright (right now)
we'll spend the night together
wake up and live forever
yeah hey alright (right now)
